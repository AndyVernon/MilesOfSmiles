    <h3>Latest Report</h3>
    <p>What a fab way to end the year by announcing that finally we will be doing a Disneyland Trip on 20th May 2016. A party of 26 will be travelling along to meet Mickey and Minnie and have a fantastic adventure! All the dedication and hard work has finally paid off for Gary, myself and the rest of our small team with thanks to the fundraisers and the supporters of our little charity. Gary and myself really cannot thank everyone enough who have contributed to Miles of Smiles in whatever way and there are far too many to mention on here so if you are reading this and you have done your bit no matter how small or big a massive thank you to helping make dreams come true! Lots to look forward to in 2016 and beyond and here is to raising more money for the next trip after this one which will hopefully be in 2017!!!</p>
    <p>January 2016</p>
    <p>Sister of much-loved Blacon teenager Jessica Versey selflessly gives up Disneyland trip - Charity left 'very humbled' by Maisy's selfless and kind gesture. One of Chester’s bravest youngsters has given her family yet another reason to be proud of her.Maisy Versey made the ultimate sacrifice at the age of just 10 when she donated her own bone marrow to save the life of her elder sister Jessica, who was battling leukaemia in 2014. The rare stem cell transplant was a success but in a tragic twist of fate, brave Jessica, of Hatton Road, Blacon, contracted an unrelated chest and lung infection and passed away in June last year aged just 19. Jessica had always been vocal about her gratitude to Maisy, now a Year 7 pupil at Queen’s Park High School, and her selflessness was recognised when she won the Child of Courage award at Dee 106.3’s Local Hero Awards last year. Chester-based charity Miles of Smiles, who sponsored the awards, had been so touched by Maisy’s bravery that they raised money to send her on the trip of a lifetime to Disneyland Paris in May 2016. But typical of Maisy’s altruistic nature, she has now passed up her chance to go to France, instead offering it to another child who ‘might not get a chance’. A letter from the Versey family to Sue Thomas, the charity’s chairperson, reads: “Please don’t take what you are about to read as ingratitude on our part but after long discussions with Maisy and no small input from her, she has decided she does not want to go to Disneyland, the reason being that it is a trip of a lifetime and Maisy will have plenty of chances to go.“With our agreement she is adamant that you should give her place to someone who may not get a chance. We agree with her and are both proud and humbled by her decision and in her words, ‘it would be great if someone poorly could go in my place’.Sue and treasurer Gary Horton said they were ‘very humbled’ to receive the letter from the Versey family.“Yet again Maisy has shown how she thinks about others,” said Sue. “Her family have a fantastic little girl who is willing to go without something that she automatically qualified for.”Sue has had a tough time choosing a child to go to Disneyland in Maisy’s place in May, but has now chosen an eight-year-old boy called Tyler Williams who lives with mum and has had no treats since being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.“Maisy will be invited to the meeting that Miles of Smiles will hold at the end of the month for all the families going on the trip to meet one another,” added Sue. “It will especially lovely for Maisy to meet Tyler and his mum Gemma.”</p>

    <p>Autumn 2015</p>
    <p>This year we have had a terrific year with so many people contributing towards making dreams come true. If I haven’t mentioned you by name then I apologise but believe me when I say you are not forgotten and we really do appreciate everything that everyone does for us.</p>
    <p>Gary and I will soon be sitting down to start to make plans for the next trip which will take place in June 2016. Really looking forward to putting that together to make sure that everyone invited has the most amazing time. It has been a while since the last trip but now the money is back in the bank account with more to look forward to over the coming months. I am going to start reviewing the events that we will put into place for next year and hope to have some great things for you all to look forward to. I will make another announcement just before the end of the year. Again I thank you for your support.</p>
    
    <p>Summer 2015</p>
    <p>Miles of Smiles is really beginning to feel the benefit now of all the fundraising that has been done on our behalf.</p>
    <p>
        New support coming on board now all the time which is fantastic. Half way through the year and we have had some great amounts of money going into the bank. Towards the end of the year Gary and I will be going through the nominations for the next trip to Disneyland Paris, which will be early June next year and starting to put together the trip which will take us 6 months to organise but something to really look forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also have some new events, such as the Miles of Smiles Quiz Challenge to look forward to with 13 teams registered already and have other things in mind to entertain you and bring that much needed money in so keep checking our FB pages and the website. Also just had news through that a group called Milking it from Chester Law are now fundraising for us. Things are on the up!!! Thank you so much for your support, you really don’t know how much it is appreciated.

    <p><strong>Announcement re Disneyland Paris Trip.</strong></p>
    <p>
        Just recently we got the costs through for our next Disneyland Paris Trip, after previously aiming to go in September this year, and were shocked at how much 
        they had increased in price since the last trip in 2012. The costs include the coach travel both in UK and Paris, flights from Manchester to Paris return. 
        Hotel accommodation in The New York Hotel which is in the heart of Disneyland and close to both park entries for those who struggle to walk. All meal vouchers 
        plus VIP ride and park entry tickets for both parks in Disneyland Paris. We also provide a packed lunch at the Eiffel Tower following a coach trip around the 
        city on our way back to the airport. Designated check in at Manchester airport and a very warm welcome from Disneyland with a buffet on arrival. 
        Insurance and a doctor are also included in the costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you know when I took over the charity we were all but wiped out due to the last trip in Sept 2012 costing around £40,000 and you also know there have been 
        some changes within the committee.The first 12 to 18 months with the new committee was used to relaunch and rebrand the charity which was slow from a fundraising 
        point of view due to the recession at the time and a lot more charities out there competing for the money along with some regular supporters taking a well earned 
        break from fundraising. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2014 the charity really began to came back to form along with many new supporters getting on board, plus our regular supporters. With lots of exciting things 
        happening this year it will put the charity in a strong position for the future. You also know we are a very small local charity with a committee that have full 
        time jobs and then organise the charity events, etc all in our own time which is no mean task! 
    </p>
    <p>
        My aim is to do the trip, that is well overdue, but also come back to some money in the bank and be at least near halfway towards having the money to do the next 
        trip within the previous timescale of every 2 years and get back on track. I am aware that some kids (and parents) have been waiting very patiently to go on the 
        next trip and I would love to say that it will happen in September this year, but myself and fellow trustees have made the decision, whether its liked or not, that 
        it will happen in May 2016 followed hopefully by another in Sept 2017. I realise that this may be a disappointment but if we do a trip now it may be that another
         will not take place for another 3 years! I do not want that to happen and I am sure that all of you will think the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        The committee and myself want to thank each and everyone one of you that support this charity either by attending events or fundraising and continued to do so 
        over the years and thank you for your patience. It has been hard work getting to where we are today but I now feel confident that the charity is on it’s way to 
        going in the right direction once again and this is all thanks to people like you supporting and believing is us.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will accept nominations off anyone for someone who is thought to be deserving of this trip in the future, all I need is contact by email or a message by 
        FB with a name, age and diagnosis and at the right time I will send a nomination form out that will need to be filled in and certain criteria met to make sure 
        we are sending the most deserving children on the trip of a lifetime. I cannot at the moment state who will be going on the next planned trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        Miles of Smiles wants to make dreams come true but the trustees decision has been taken so that future trips can be planned in order for more sick or severely 
        disabled children to experience the holiday of a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are now well into 2015. Lots of things to look forward to this year! Thank you to everyone for their continuous support.
        This year we welcome the North Wales Charity Ramblers on board who will be raising money for us. 
        Last year their chosen charity received a total of over £11,000 so we are very much looking forward to November and seeing what the grand total will be!
    </p>
    <p>
        We also have a couple of cycling fundraisers being done for us this year, one of whom raised over £10,000 in 2013 and 2014 so yet again a terrific amount of money 
        and will keep you all updated on this. Mara is doing her 5 mile a day for 99 days and a marathon on the 100th day and aiming to raise £5000 so 
        please support her as much as you can. Ellis Whittams support finishes in May so again another nice amount of money coming into the charity!
    </p>
    <p>
        A trip will be on the cards very soon and an announcement made by the end of this month. We want to make sure we are back to having these trips on a regular basis 
        hence trying to build up the money in the bank account. No way do we want to go back to a zero bank balance and climb the hill again! 
        Will keep updating you all. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking foward to seeing you at our events next year and once again we truly appreciate all the support we get.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to wish all our supporters a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from myself and the committee.
        2014 has been the year in which the charity started to come back into its own following the forming of the
        new committee last year and the rebranding. Some great events and some fantastic people have raised money for us.
        So proud of each and every one of you for the support. I hope to be able to make a very special announcement by March 2015.
        I am currently busy sorting out the diary for next year and putting our regular events into place and will then be touting or 
        blackmailing for some fundraisers!!  We have a massive new supported in 2015 of which I will release details in 
        January and by all accounts they will be raising a very large amount of money for us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking foward to seeing you at our events next year and once again we truly appreciate all the support we get.
    </p>
    <p>
        That time of year already! Now in the process of getting ready for the Halloween and Xmas events that will tie up the year of event organising for us.
        So far it has been a superb year for the charity with new supporters coming on board all the time and that also includes 2015.
        I will release more details of some new fundraising events and fund raisers in January.
    </p>
    <p>I hope to see some of you at the events leading up to the end of the year with the kids, always nice to see you and hope that you continue to support 
        the charity for many years to come! I will make another statment by the end of the year. Thank you as always.
    </p>

    <p>
        Miles of Smiles is doing so well at the moment with lots of new supporters coming on board. Of course we won't and don't forget the regulars as well!  
        We love to see you all!
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the changes on the committee at the start of Jan 2013 it of course takes time to put things into place and get things moving again and I am absolutely 
        thrilled at how busy we are getting. I am hoping that in the long run we can follow in the previous committees footsteps of raising over a million pounds and 
        sending over 300 children away. The last trip in 2012 wiped us out so last year it was starting from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are now holding some brilliant events, even though I say it myself! Gary and I work hard at giving you the sort of events you like to attend which in turn 
        brings us in the money. There is not enough space to say thank you to individuals but if you have raised money for Miles of Smiles or attended an event then you 
        have contributed towards that next trip and we thank you for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would however like to thank Ellis Whittam who are raising money from June 2014 to May 2015 for us by doing various fundraising events, raffles etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course Gary, myself and the committee cannot organise every single event but if you have an idea or want to do an event and need help with it including publicity 
        then please ask, we will never refuse!
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you so much again from myself and the team at Miles of Smiles.
    </p>




        <p>
        At the end of January so soon! Our events start to kick off in February with a CommuniTea organised by the Chester University students who always fundraise for us 
        every year. Following on from that we have lots of great events for everyone to look forward to throughout the year. We really need word spreading about how much 
        this local charity does for local children and their parents so if you can get the word out about Miles of Smiles to everyone you know and ask for fundraising 
        or donations of money or raffle prizes we will allbenefit and see some more children go on a trip to Disneyland Paris.
        I would just like to finish off with I hope to see lots of you at the events as we love to keep in touch with you all, especially Andy Vernon who has created 
        this fabulous new website!
        </p>
        <p>
        I would like to wish everyone a Happy New year for 2014. There are some people I would like to thank for supporting Miles of 
        Smiles starting with Andy Vernon for designing this new website. 
        As most of you know Andy and Sandra went on the trip in 2012 with their boys Jake and Kieran and have attended most events 
        Miles of Smiles have organised ever since so I would just like to say a massive thank you for doing this for us from myself 
        and the rest of the committee. I would also like to thank Catherine Hibbert at The Bears Paw for jumping on board with us 
        and raising some money for which she believes is a great cause, Massey Metals in Saltney, The Dee Miller, Chris and Paula 
        as our newest recruits and Duttons in Chester, all of which are continuing to organise events throughout 2014. We have 
        had some fabulous sellout events this last year and are already sorting dates out for even more events in 2014 and hope to 
        see as many of you there as possible! There are of course loads of people I could mention who have always supported the 
        charity including Angie Fairweather and The Peacock and normally John Jennings who this last year as not been able to do much 
        but I know will be raising his game again in 2014. To those I don't mention its not because I have forgotten about you its 
        just there are too many of you to put in this space but for those of you that have raised money we all thank you very much, 
        it is greatly appreciated. It has been a hard year and we still do not have enough for me to say we will be doing a trip so 
        please spread the word about this fantastic charity and if you know of anyone who would be willing to spend some time either 
        organising or donating please let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish everyone good health in 2014 and hope to see you soon.
        <br />
        With thanks
        <br />
        Sue Thomas - Chair.
