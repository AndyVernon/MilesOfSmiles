<h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        How it all began: In 1991 a Chester Chronicle employee who had been involved with various fundraising events for many 
        different charities decided to set up a charity that would enable children with a terminal illness, sickness of disability 
        to have the 'Holiday of a Lifetime' to either Lapland or Disneyland Paris, which had just opened that year. 
        Tecwyn Williams along with his wife Linda came up with the name and Miles of Smiles was born! Five years later 
        Tecwyn then moved on to other charitable causes but the rest of the committee and fundraisers continued along over the 
        years, along with Gary Horton who is the only surviving committee member, and over the 21 years well over a million 
        pounds has been raised.

        Over 300 children have been on one of the trips that used to be annually, but unfortunately due to the recent recession 
        is now having to be every other year. A lot of money is involved to do one of these trips, approximately £40,000, which 
        would cover the costs of normally 18 children plus parent/carer, coach pick up from both Deeside and Chester, flights 
        from Manchester airport to Charles de Gaulle in Paris and onwards to Disneyland Paris. The accommodation is a 5 star hotel 
        and VIP badges and special passes for the rides so that there is no queuing and meal vouchers are provided for breakfast, 
        lunch and dinner. The trip ends with a sightseeing tour round Paris on the way back to the airport with a stop off at the 
        Eiffel Tower and a packed lunch. The trip is both beneficial for both the child and the parent/carer and memories are made 
        that stay with them for a lifetime. Many people decide to do some fundraising for Miles of Smiles once they have been on the 
        trip, the comments are so positive, and they would like other children to have the same experience.

        Twenty one years later we are a small committee of 5 volunteers and have been involved with Miles of Smiles for a while before 
        being given the opportunity and privilege of being responsible for carrying on with this worthwhile cause. Also over 21 years 
        there have been many people individually and as either groups, associations, businesses and companies that have helped to 
        raise money in many different ways from running on a treadmill in a supermarket to Xmas fairs and lots of other imaginative 
        ways and whether it is £5 or £5000 we greatly appreciate every penny and all monies go towards the next trip.
