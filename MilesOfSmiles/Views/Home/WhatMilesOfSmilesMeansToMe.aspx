    <h3>What Miles of Smiles means to me</h3>
    <p>
        I have twin boys who have learning difficulties and one of who has ASD. 
        We have always found it difficult to go on holiday and when we found out that we were lucky enough to be 
        given places on the trip to Disneyland Paris the looks on the boys faces was amazing. This was nothing compared to
        the fabulous time we had when we were there. From the moment we caught the coach in Deeside, through the time at the airport
        to the 3 days at the park we did not have to do a thing. The Miles of Smiles team were amazing and were there when we needed 
        them bit we had the freedom to do what we wanted. This was truly a trip of a lifetime that both the boys, my wife and myself
        will remember for the rest of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        We try to do everything we can to help Miles of Smiles take more children on this trip of a lifetime, and I have built this
        Website for Miles of Smiles in my spare time in a hope that I can give a little back.
